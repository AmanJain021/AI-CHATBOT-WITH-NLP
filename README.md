This project involves the creation of an AI Chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. The chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user queries based on predefined intents, using keyword matching and semantic similarity techniques. The main objective of this task is to demonstrate how foundational NLP libraries like NLTK and spaCy can be integrated to build a terminal-based chatbot that simulates natural human conversation. The chatbot interprets user input, preprocesses it by tokenizing and lemmatizing the text, and then compares it against a set of predefined intents stored in a structured intents.json file. Each intent contains a category (e.g., greeting, goodbye, weather, help), sample patterns (user inputs), and associated responses. Using spaCyâ€™s powerful language models, the chatbot is able to calculate similarity between user input and training patterns, even if the exact words do not match, providing a more flexible and natural user experience. If no clear match is found, the bot returns a default fallback response indicating it couldn't understand the input. The intents.json file allows the system to be easily updated with new domains or topics without altering the core logic of the chatbot, making the application scalable and adaptable. The script is developed using Python 3.13.5 in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), with environment setup managed through a virtual environment. The user interacts with the chatbot through a simple command-line interface, entering messages and receiving real-time responses in return. The implementation handles case-insensitivity, noise removal, tokenization, and intent matching while maintaining fast response time.From an educational and professional standpoint, this project is a stepping stone into the world of conversational AI. It helps developers understand the building blocks of natural language understanding, including text preprocessing, semantic similarity, intent classification, and conversational design. While the current implementation is rule-based and relies on similarity scoring, it sets the groundwork for future integration with machine learning models or transformer-based language models (like BERT or GPT) for more advanced understanding and response generation. This chatbot structure is highly applicable in real-world scenarios like customer support, help desk automation, virtual assistants, or simple FAQ bots for websites and mobile apps. It can be deployed in enterprise workflows to automate repetitive query handling and free up human agents for more complex tasks.The project include a Python script (chatbot.py), an intents data file (intents.json), a requirements.txt listing all dependencies. The chatbot is modular and lightweight, requiring no external APIs or databases, which makes it easy to run and test on any machine. Overall, this project demonstrates the practical use of NLP tools to build intelligent systems that can understand and respond to human language. It reflects core concepts in natural language understanding and provides a strong foundation for anyone interested in conversational AI development using Python and open-source NLP libraries.
